# Rodo - An auto API Record and Replay MITMProxy Script: Your Painless Client-Side Solution for End-to-End Testing

**Rodo is a Python script that extends [Mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org) and provides a fast and easy solution for mocking an API server during client-side end-to-end testing. It eliminates the need to modify the API architecture or configure a mock server on the server-side.**

With Rodo, you can record the entire end-to-end testing process and save it as API snapshot files.
During subsequent validation tests, you can use Rodo's playback feature as a local mock API server to ensure consistent data throughout the testing phase.

This enhances the stability of end-to-end testing by encapsulating all access logic within the script.

You can customize it as needed or contribute by submitting issues or pull requests.
